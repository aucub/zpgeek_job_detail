      "introduce": "Cognizant Mobility is a specialized solution provider for complex electronic and IT systems in trend topics that move the market. Whether software development and operation, connectivity solutions, E/E complete vehicle development, data analytics, cyber security, system integration or testing - with knowledge and experience we provide our customers with the necessary impulses, the technical know-how, the products and the hands to achieve this common goal.\nCognizant Mobility originated from a certified aviation company. Due to numerous problems with the controllability of the Starfighter, resulting in many crashes and tragic fatalities, the Federal Ministry of Defense demanded a solution in 1963. The foundation for today's Cognizant Mobility was laid. By viewing the aircraft as a holistic system, our engineers succeeded in analyzing the fault behavior of the components and making the technology controllable - thus increasing the safety and operational readiness of the Starfighter.\nCognizant Mobility has been providing know-how to automobile manufacturers and suppliers with locations around the world for almost 30 years. The starting shot in the automotive industry was given in 1984. This was followed by the consistent expansion of the automotive division with projects for BMW and other well-known German OEMs. Long-term partnerships connect us to the present day. \nEven nowadays, the technology transfer between the industries distinguishes us and provides the decisive competitive edge. In automotive and avionics, the focus is on highly complex technologies and increasingly networked systems. In the future, we will continue to expand this lead and be an engineering partner, process know-how provider, technology consultant and IT expert all in one.",
